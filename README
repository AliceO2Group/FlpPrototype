*** Global build ***
To configure and build everything : make 
To configure everything : make configure
To build everything : make build
To install everything : make install
To clean everything : make clean
To delete build folders (deeper clean) : make clobber
"Make" will always configure so you might want to use "make build" most of the time. 

*** Subproject build ***
cd projectTemplate
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. 
make -j4
make install
