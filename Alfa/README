1. If you need compiled version
	Go to aidrefsrv101:/home/alfa/AliceO2/build_o2/bin

2. If you've changed source and you want to compile (you can use alfa@aidrefsrv101:/home/alfa)
	Put the source files to AliceO2/devices/flp2epn
	Go to AliceO2/build_o2/
	Run make
	Binaries will be located in AliceO2/build_o2/bin

3. Test set-up
	Binaries were copied to aidrefsrv10 and aidrefsrv12, therefore you can perform tests over 40Gb/s Ethernet
